Objective:
Create a WordList class (subclass of list) and a WordMap class that builds a dictionary mapping the first letter of each word to all words starting with that letter.

Requirements:

Classes & Inheritance:
- WordList should inherit from the built-in list type and only contain strings.

Methods:

1. WordList:
    - __init__(self, words: list[str]):
        Initialize the list, ensuring all items are strings.
    - __str__(self) -> str:
        Return the list items joined by a dash ("-").

2. WordMap:
    - __init__(self, word_list: WordList):
        Construct a dictionary (self.mapping) that maps the first letter of each word to a list of words starting with that letter.

Example Input:
wl = WordList(["apple", "banana", "apricot", "blueberry", "cherry"])
print(wl)
wm = WordMap(wl)
print(wm.mapping["a"])
print(wm.mapping["b"])

Expected Output:
apple-banana-apricot-blueberry-cherry
['apple', 'apricot']
['banana', 'blueberry']
